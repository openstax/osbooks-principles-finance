    <para id="para-00001">Author Mark Twain spoke for many when he wrote, “October—this is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.” Twain’s comment, though humorous, reflects the serious risks associated with investing in the stock market.

However, past performance can provide targets or benchmarks around which to build expectations. We can learn about the past to prepare for future possibilities, or we can suffer what Winston Churchill warned, “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”</para>
