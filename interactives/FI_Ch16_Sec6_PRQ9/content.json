  "taskDescription": "You will be living in your college town for two more years. You are considering purchasing a townhouse that will cost you $250,000 today. You estimate that if you do, your expenses for each of the next two years will be $6,000 less than if you rented an apartment. You think that you would be able to lease the townhouse to another college student afterward for $12,000 per year and that your taxes, maintenance, and other expenses for the townhouse would be $5,000 per year. You expect to lease the townhouse for five years before you sell it, and you expect to be able to sell the townhouse for $275,000. Use Excel to create an NPV profile for this undertaking. If it will cost you 3% to borrow money, should you buy the townhouse? What if it will cost you 8% to borrow money?",
