Your friend Luis promises that heâ€™ll pay you back $4,900 that he owes you three years from now, so you will add that to the payment you make at the start of year 4. Then, at the start of year 5, you will increase your payment to $1,400; in year 6, to $1,500; and in year 7, to $1,600. Every payment will be deposited in a fund bearing 4% interest compounded annually. How much will you have set aside for your boat at the end of the seventh year?",
